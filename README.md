It includes projects created for Numerical Methods in Physics lesson. 

I am taking PHYS315 Numerical Methods in Physics lesson right now. In this lesson, it is aimed to write codes in C language numerically. Here are the projects that I wrote for the lesson.

First three projects were written to find root of an equation.
- Bi Section Method
- Secant Method
