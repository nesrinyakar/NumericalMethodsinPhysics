# Numerical Methods in Physics
It includes projects created for Numerical Methods in Physics lesson. 

I am taking PHYS315 Numerical Methods in Physics lesson right now. In this lesson, it is aimed to write codes in C language numerically. Here are the projects that I wrote for the lesson.

ROOT FINDING
--
Three projects were written to find root of an equation. Methods to find root are listed below.
- Bi Section Method
- Secant Method
- Newton-Raphson Method

Bi Section Method
 -
This method uses Intermediate Value Theorem of Calculus. For continuos function f(x), if f(a) * f(b) < 0 or f(a) * f(b) > 0 then there is at least one root between a and b. In the method, first interval is chosen. Then it is checked whether there is a root between the interval. If there is a root, midpoint is calculated. Values of function for each interval points are multiplied by value of function for midpoint. According to results, interval is changed. The process continues like this until finding the root.

 INTEGRATION

 Four projects were written to find integral of a function. Methods used are listed below.
 - Rectangular Method
 - Trapezoid Method
 - Simpson 1/3 Method
