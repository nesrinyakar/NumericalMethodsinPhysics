# Numerical Methods in Physics
It includes projects created for PHYS315 Numerical Methods in Physics lesson. In this lesson, it is aimed to write codes in C language numerically. Here are the numerical methods and topics of projects.

ROOT FINDING
--
Three projects were written to find root of an equation. Methods to find root are listed below.
- Bi Section Method
- Secant Method
- Newton-Raphson Method

 
 INTEGRATION
 --
 Four projects were written to find integral of a function. Methods used are listed below.
 - Rectangular Method
 - Trapezoid Method
 - Simpson 1/3 Method
 
 
4th ORDER RUNGE-KUTTA METHOD
--
This method was used to solve second order differential equations with given initial conditions. Numerical and analytical solutions were compared by plotting the solutions on the same graph using GNUPlot, also.


LINEAR REGRESSION
--
Linear regression method was used. 

LEAST SQUARES
--
For nonlinear equation ,which is y=a*e^b x, regression was done by nonlinear least square method.

GAUSS ELIMINATION
--
Gauss elimination method was used to solve system of linear equations.

SPECIFIC EQUATIONS
--
Three equations listed below were solved numerically. 
- Laplace Equation
- Wave Equation
- Heat Equation


FINAL PROJECT
--
Topic of the project is vibrations in the Lennard-Jones Potential and calculation of linear expansion coefficient. For the material hydrogen molecule was chosen. Hydrogen molecule in LJ Potential was analyzed and its linear expansion coefficient was calculated. All details are given in the report.
