# NumericalMethodsinPhysics
It includes projects created for Numerical Methods in Physics lesson. 

I am taking PHYS315 Numerical Methods in Physics lesson right now. In this lesson, it is aimed to write codes in C language numerically. After I write codes, I will share them in this repository. 
First three projects were written to find root of an equation.
1.Bi Section Method
2.Secant Method
3.Newton-Raphson Method
